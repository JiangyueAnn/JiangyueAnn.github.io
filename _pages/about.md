I am currently a Research Assistant in the Median Group at the Department of Computer Science, Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), under the supervision of Professor [Yu Zhang](https://yuzhanghk.github.io/). I earned my Master's degree in Control Science and Engineering from the School of Automation at Central South University in June 2024, where I was advised by Professor [Biao Luo](https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/luobiao/zh_CN/index.htm). I am in the post-master's, pre-doctoral stage of my academic career, preparing to pursue a Ph.D.

My main research interests lie in the area of deep reinforcement learning, specifically focusing on sparse reward problems and multi-goal reinforcement learning guided by large language models.
